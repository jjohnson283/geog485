	<h1>Deep Dive #3</h1>
	<h2>What is the high-level description of the problem/question you want to help answer through the presentation of a collection of geographic data over the internet? Please answer in a short paragraph.</h2>
	<p>With the recent devestating mudslide outside of Oso, Washington I thought I'd address the problem of landslides in the United States. Landslides occur all over the country yet there is not much done in the way of mitigatation. My map will show where the most risk of landslides is so people can see how widespread this natural and potentially devestating phenomenon is. Also I will overlay a New Mexico KML file to highlight danger areas locally.</p>
	<h2>Who is the target audience for the information you want to provide?</h2>
	<p>Anyone who is interested in the prevelance of landslides in the U.S.</p>
	<h2>What geographic region does your problem area represent? Please describe it in words (e.g. New Mexico, Alberta Canada, etc.) and define it in terms of a geographic (WGS84) (latitude and longitude) bounding box</h2>
	<p>The map will focus on the Western United States but with the ability to navigate to any area of interest in the country. There will be a vector overlay of New Mexico to get a better understanding of danger zones locally. Also there will be vector overlays highlighting the most recent landslide event in outside of Oso, Washington. There will be a polygon covering the extent of displaced land as well as a line string to show the path of the landslide. Also there will be two WMS overlays, one that shows Landslide Danger and Susceptability (raster) and one showing costly landslides around the country.</p>
	<h2>What is the scale of your map (local, regional, continental, global)? How will this translate into your selection of an appropriate default zoom level for your map?</h2>
	<p>The scale of this map will be regional. I will put the zoom level at 8 because it zooms nicely on Anchorage and the surrounding area.</p>
	<h2>Embed a Google Map in your writeup that is based upon your responses to questions 1-4 above. </h2>
