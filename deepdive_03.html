	<h1>Deep Dive #3</h1>
	<h2>What is the high-level description of the problem/question you want to help answer through the presentation of a collection of geographic data over the internet? Please answer in a short paragraph.</h2>
	<p>With the recent devestating mudslide outside of Oso, Washington I thought I'd address the problem of landslides in the United States. Landslides occur all over the country yet there is not much done in the way of mitigatation. My map will show where the most risk of landslides is so people can see how widespread this natural and potentially devestating phenomenon is. Also I will overlay a New Mexico KML file to highlight danger areas locally.</p>
	<h2>Who is the target audience for the information you want to provide?</h2>
	<p>Anyone who is interested in the prevelance of landslides in the U.S.</p>
	<h2>What geographic region does your problem area represent? Please describe it in words (e.g. New Mexico, Alberta Canada, etc.) and define it in terms of a geographic (WGS84) (latitude and longitude) bounding box</h2>
	<p>The map will focus on the Western United States but with the ability to navigate to any area of interest in the country.</p>
	<p>EPSG: 4326 BBOX=</p>
	<h2>What types of data do you want to include in your project? Include a description (data content: e.g. elevation data, hydrographic survey, etc.) and types (i.e. raster, vector).</h2>
	<p>There will be a vector overlay of New Mexico to get a better understanding of danger zones locally. Also there will be vector overlays highlighting the most recent landslide event in outside of Oso, Washington. There will be a polygon covering the extent of displaced land as well as a line string to show the path of the landslide. Also there will be two WMS overlays, one that shows Landslide Danger and Susceptability (raster) and one showing costly landslides around the country.</p>
	<h2What projection will you use for the presentation of your project data? Again, describe it, provide your reasoning for selection, and provide the corresponding EPSG code.</h2>
	<p>EPSG: 4326. All of the WMS services I wanted to to use for the map were EPSG 4326 compatable</p>
	<h2>Where do you anticipate acquiring data for the project from?</h2>
	<p>From the National Atlas website as they have many WMS services dealing with landslides in the U.S.</p>
	<h2>What barriers to acquiring and processing the needed data do you anticipate?</h2>
	<p>I anticipate some WMS services not being queriable, requiring me to search elsewhere</p>
	<h2>While you are going to continue to acquire additional data for the project over the next couple of assignments, begin acquiring data for your selected project now. Specifically, find 5 datasets that are consistent with your description of the problem you are going to work on, and use ogrinfo or gdalinfo and any associated metadata to describe them in brief by answering the following questions:</h2>
	<ul>
	<li>Name of Dataset?</li>
	<li>Type of Data (Raster/Vector)?</li>
	<li>Format?</li>
	<li>Coordinate Reference System?</li>
	<li>Spatial Extents of Dataset?/li>
	</ul>
