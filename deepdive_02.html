	<h2>Question 4: What OGC request would you use to inform the configuration of a client application (like ArcGIS) about an OGC service that you want to add layers from?</h2>
	<p>answer</p>

		
	<h2>Question 5:Which OGC request would you submit under the following circumstances (include both the service type [e.g. WMS, WFS, WCS], and the request [e.g. GetMap, GetCapabilities, GetCoverage, etc.] in your answer) </h2>
	<ul>
			<li>You want a map image representing three layers of data in a single JPEG for a specified area of interest. </li>
			<ul>
			<li>
			</ul>
			<li>You want to retrieve data representing geometries and associated attributes for a road network, with the returned data in GML.
			<ul>
			<li>
			</ul>
			<li>You want to retrieve data representing a digital elevation model (a raster dataset) in the form of a GeoTIFF.</li>
			<ul>
			<li>
			</ul>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Question 6: What are the EPSG codes of the following Spatial Reference Systems</h2>
	<ul>
			<li>WGS 84 (Geodetic CRS [geographic 2d])</li>
			<ul>
			<li>
			</ul>
			<li>NAD83 / UTM zone 13N </li>
			<ul>
			<li>
			</ul>
			<li>NAD27 / UTM zone 13N</li>
			<ul>
			<li>
			</ul>

		<h2>Question 7: Use the cs2cs utility to convert the following WGS84 Geographic Coordinates into UTM Zone 13, NAD83 coordinates. Include your cs2cs command and output in your writeup.</h2>
	<ul>
			<li>35°14′19.29″ N, 107°36′30.67″ W (Mount Taylor Summit) </li>
			<ul>
			<li>
			</ul>
			<li>34°16′40.34″ N, 103°19′28.49″ W (Blackwater Draw)</li>
			<ul>
			<li>
			</ul>
			
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Question 8: Retrieve the GetCapabilities XML response from the following WMS, and answer the following questions.</h2>
<ul>
			<li>What is the Title of the service? </li>
			<ul>
			<li>
			</ul>
			<li>Who is the Contact Person for questions about the service? </li>
			<ul>
			<li>
			</ul>
			<li>Who is the Contact Person for questions about the service? </li>
			<ul>
			<li>
			</ul>
			<li>What are the available image formats for the GetMap request for this service? </li>
			<ul>
			<li>
			</ul>
			<li>What are the SRS/CRS’s for which layers from this service are available (remember that nested layers inherit the SRS/CRS of their parent layers).</li>
			<ul>
			<li>
			</ul>
			</ul>
			
			<h2>Question 9:Formulate a GetMap request for the “tl_2010_35_bg10” layer from this service, for a 500x500 pixel map image that is 0.05-degrees wide and 0.05-degress high, with the SW corner of the map image located at 35°N and -106°45'E. Include in your write-up the complete GetMap request and the returned map image.</h2>
